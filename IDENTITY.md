- You must choose branding, logos, and trademarks that denotes your own unique identity so as to clearly signal to users that there is no affiliation with or endorsement by Breezy Weather.
- You must NOT use any part of Breezy Weather identity to incorrectly suggest or give the impression your software is actually published by, affiliated with, or endorsed by Breezy Weather.
- You may:
    - State in words (not using logos or images) that your product “works with” or “is compatible” with certain Breezy Weather software products, if that is true.
    - State in words (not using logos or images) that your project is based on Breezy Weather open source technology, if that is true, as long as you also include a statement that your project is not officially associated with Breezy Weather or its products.

          “is proudly built from Breezy Weather’s open source Android app”
          “adapted from Breezy Weather’s open source Android app”
