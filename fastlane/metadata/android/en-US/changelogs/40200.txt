Background updates logic was entirely rewritten in this version.

<ul>
<li>Refresh progress is now displayed in notification when weather update is happening</li>
<li>If there are locations which failed to refresh in background, a notification will inform you and you will be able to access an error log for details (experimental).</li>
<li>When having multiple locations, refreshes are done in parallel</li>
<li>A preference was added to be able to ignore background refreshes when battery is low</li>
<li>Today and tomorrow forecast notifications are now sent even if network is not available at requested time</li>
<li>Fix alert notification logic being executed multiple times resulting in same alert being sent multiple times (this doesnâ€™t fix duplicate alerts emitted as different alerts by AccuWeather).</li>
</ul>
